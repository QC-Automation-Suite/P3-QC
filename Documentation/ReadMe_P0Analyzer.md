# P0 Analyzer Read Me

---

## Overview

The P0 Analyzer automation provides support to a Trainer or QC Auditor tasked with assessing the Project 0 submissions of a given batch. The `ReadMe.md` file of each Project 0 submission GitHub repository is checked for whether or not all of the MVP (Minimal Viable Product) features have been implemented. After this these repositories are compared (using the `git diff` command with specific parameters) and key statistics are computed. These statistics are to assist the Trainer / QC Auditor in identifying potential instances of code plagarism.

## MVP Features

In the markdown language (file extension .md). The subsections for the MVP functions need to be noted in this format:
- [x] Take in Project 0 Specifications
	* Read from the GitHub URL to the _project requirements_ `ReadMe.md` file from GitHub for the desired batch's Project 0.
	* Example: `https://github.com/[ batch organization ]/trainer-code/wiki/P0-Requirements.md`.
- [x] Execute and process the output of `git diff` command for each distinct pair of Project 0 GitHub repositories in the batch.
- [x] Generate a ranked list comprising of each Project 0 repository in the batch with respect to the analysis.
- [x] Find the Mean Similarity (index) for the batch with respect to the `git diff` command outputs.
- [x] Generate a PDF report and send it as an attachment via email.

## `git diff` Command Notes

This Automation will take advantage of a built-in function for running a git diff of the given user repositories. Once the repositories have been cloned, our automation will compare each repository to a different repository once. 

Modifications can be made to compare each repository to every other repository twice, with one being a comparer, and the other acting as the compared. For this automation, saving time was a key factor so each repository is compared once, and a report is generated with the created information. The command used to compare is listed below.

`git diff --no-index -B1% -M1% --find-copies-harder [repository_1] [repository_2]`

This will compare every file and give a percentage value based on its similarity to another file. To assist with finding individuals that are willing to copy and paste code, any files that show a 95% match or higher are marked as one-one and denoted as such in the report.

## Input of Automation

Please ensure that the associates understand the rules of creating proper README.md files to take advantage of the reporting features.
A storage bucket titled “Repos” must be created, and should be created for you when using the website, an excel file will need to be stored there.

The excel file must have the cells filled in the following format (proper capitalization is required):

|Name|UserName|Repo URL|
|--|--|--|
|Associate 1|Github username 1|URL1|
|Associate 2|Github username 2|URL2|

## Output of Automation

All the given output files generated by the git diff automation will attempt to be upload to your orchestrator if you have a storage bucket named “OutputFiles”. This will assist you as you will want to look through the output to know if a particular associate shows a high number of one to one files or if they have a high similarity percentage..

A .pdf report is then generated in the WordEntities folder with:

A report for each repository if they completed MVP or if the README.md is present and if that repository has any one-to-one file match with any of the other listed repositories. The average similarity index shows the presented average generated when compared against the other listed repositories.

A raw data table is appended to the report with the following contents:

|teamA|teamB|oneToOneAlert|meanSimIndex|matchCount|
|--|--|--|--|--|
 
A data table with associate information is also appended to the report with the following contents:
|Repo Url|Repo Name|Team Name|Username|
|--|--|--|--|
